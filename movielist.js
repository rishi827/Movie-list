A facility called The Complex was created by Supreme Yaskin, and a commoner had to pay a huge price to get admission there. The setup resembled the conditions that prevail in first-world countries, where people overused resources and wasted them in the name of convenience while the rest of the world couldn’t even afford the basic necessities of life. A bounty hunter by the name of Bhairava, who lived in the city of Kashi, dreamt of entering The Complex one day and leading a life of privilege. But little did Bhairava know what fate had in store for him. So, let’s recap the events of Kalki 2898 AD and find out if Bhairava was able to enter The Complex."
